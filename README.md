# Weather-Analysis
Analyzing the weather and climate patterns using data from https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search?datasetid=GHCND
Inspired by Michele Vallisneri and LinkedIn Learning's 'Python Data Analysis' Course.

Although the concept of this project is simple (i.e. analyze climate data of US), I wanted to venture further into the analyses and ask 'why?'. Is there a difference in weather between California, New York, and Florida? What about states that are right next to each other like California and Oregon?
